"""GEMM Optimization - V3: Optimized GEMM

- Double buffering for overlapping compute and memory operations
- Memory access pattern optimization (e.g., padding, alignment)
- Loop unrolling for compute-intensive sections
- Vectorized operations where possible
- Pipeline optimization to maximize throughput
